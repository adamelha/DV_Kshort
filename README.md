# DV_Kshort

## The latest source code file is: Kshort_DDL_Niv_1Nov.cxx
## Kshort_DDL.cxx is the older file, which have many things but most of those are unecessary. Kshort_DDL_Niv_1Nov.cxx is the first iteration of Kshort_DDL.cxx
## Kshort_DDL.h is the header file to the source file. This file has been modified after its creation, but we don't need to worry about that one.
## jo_Kshort_DDL.py is the joboptions file created for Kshort analysis, although some portions have already been modified, still it needs to be modified
## Just to remind: the .cxx and .h files are placed in the src/ directory of your DDLStudies package whereas the .py should be present in share/ of DDLStudies package.
